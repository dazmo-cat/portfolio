<div class="point-goals">
  <p>The goal for teaching myself HTML and CSS is to make a career change.  I have always enjoyed learning new things about computers.  In fact, when I was a kid a had a Commodore64 
  and taught myself Basic.  I learned to write simple code for text based choose-your-own-adventure games. I learned DOS when I upgraded to 386, admittedly only enough to perform simple 
  operations.  When the GUI became the popular choice for operating systems, I turned to hardware and learned how to put the components together for a working computer.</p>
