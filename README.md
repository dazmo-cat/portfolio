# Keith Gregory's Online Portfolio
<p>Welcome to my portfolio, this is a repository website build for my projects and progress in web development.  It is a work in prgress, and as such will continue to grow and change as I develop my skills.</p>
<p>I may also set placeholders for ideas for future projects here.</p>
<p>I am new to HTML and CSS.  I am self-taught, so I'm sure there will be plenty of mistakes at first.  My goal is to improve consistently as I get a better understanding of web development.</p>
